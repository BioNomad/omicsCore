# Introduction to Linux

This workshop will be broken into three parts - command line basics, bash scripting, and batch jobs. In command line basics we will cover what command line is and how to use common bash/shell commands. In bash scripting we will learn how to turn these commands into a script. And finally in batch jobs we will cover how to run these scripts on a high performance computing cluster.
