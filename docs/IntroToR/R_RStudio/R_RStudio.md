# R and RStudio

If you don't already have R installed on your computer you can install it at [The R Project for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/). Now once you have R installed on your machine you'll need a way to create code with it. While you can do so from command line, most people prefer to use RStudio to do so.
