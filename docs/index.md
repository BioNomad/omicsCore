## Introduction

Here we dive into the omics and how to analyze data derived from DNA, RNA, Protein, Metabolites and the Microbiome. Before diving into these analysis workshops, it is recommended that you have a familiarity with R and Linux. You can learn more about R and Linux via the links below. If you are already comfortable with these skills feel free to forge ahead!
