# HPC

## Introduction to Workload Management
Now that we have covered Linux commands and how to put them in a script we can talk about how to manage running scripts. Some jobs could take a few minutes and some could take a few days depending on resources. It is at this point that we usually leverage High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters. Typically, you'll get to a cluster either through the HPC website, where they will have a way for you to open a linux environment online or through an ssh command that looks like this:

```ssh yourHpcCluster```

## Login Node

Now that you have made it to the HPC cluster, you will be at a login node. And you can think of a login node like a waiting room. **DO NOT** run any scripts here. For that you will need to to right up a batch script.
